Taking request of http with the help of node.js to openweathermap api to showcase the weather condition of a particular city.
#Make the weatherproject directory and paste all file in it .Then make another dir inside named public where you put css file.Rest all files remain in the weatherproject directory.

# Summary::
The project is a weather application that provides users with weather information for a specified city. It combines several technologies to achieve its functionality:

1. **Express.js**: This is a web application framework for Node.js. It is used to create the back end of the application. Express handles routing, API requests, and serving the initial HTML page.

2. **https (Node.js module)**: It's used to make HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API. This is where the application fetches weather data based on the user's input (city name).

3. **body-parser**: This middleware is used to parse incoming request bodies, which is particularly useful for parsing form data. It's used to extract the city name entered by the user.

4. **path (Node.js module)**: It's used to manage file paths, specifically for serving static files and locating the HTML file.

The purpose of using these technologies is as follows:

- **Express.js**: It provides a framework to build a web server and handle routing. It serves the HTML page and manages the API request/response flow.

- **https**: It's used to connect to external APIs (in this case, the OpenWeatherMap API) and retrieve weather data.

- **body-parser**: It allows the application to parse form data sent by the user to extract the city name.

- **path**: It helps locate and serve the HTML file and manage file paths.

The application's workflow is as follows:

1. The user enters a city name in the provided input field.

2. The user submits the form, triggering a POST request.

3. The server uses the city name from the POST request to make a request to the OpenWeatherMap API.

4. The server receives weather data from the API.

5. The server constructs an HTML response with the weather information in a card-like format.

6. The HTML response is sent back to the user, displaying the weather data in a visually appealing manner.

The purpose is to provide a simple and functional weather application that allows users to get weather information for a specific city in an attractive card format. The technology stack combines back-end and front-end components to achieve this goal.
